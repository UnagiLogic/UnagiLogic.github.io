This is a goal I'm working on. I'm using the Readme as a Developers Log to showcase and record.

I'm gonna keep track of what I've done in here just for fun.

11/12/2023
I made my Git Repository following the instructions found here https://pages.github.com/
After 6 hours I found out Repositories don't like to be placed on exFat file systems
which was why I couldn't get past the "record ownership information step"

11/13/2023 - It's 3:45AM and now that I'm using a NTFS File System, everything worked like a charm. I've added an index.html with some bare bones code, an app.js with even less code, and an adventure_theme.css with a little bit of code. With this success, I'm going to commit and go to sleep.

Commit 1: Today I worked on getting some more elements in the HTML and CSS for testing purposes. I'm gonna make changes until it looks how I want. I made an initial commit to see the in progress work. 

Commit 2: Changed the Title to the top of the page, and downsized the image so It's a little more center stage. I'm realizing that the image I'm currently using I wanted in the background and then buttons layered on top of it. I will need to think about how to approach this change and then continue forward.

Observation 1: One observationn I've made while starting this project is my goal to make a unique experience for players. I've always wanted to create an experience that depends of each other to accomplish large goals. This is a potential goal of this project but when I start to ask questions about how to accomplish this, lots of situations arise. I'm gonna post some of the demanding questions so I can look back at them from time to time as I work on this project.

Questions to ask:
I want resource gathering to feel unique. If players can't gather resources that they need fast enough, what else are they doing in the meantime?

Commit 3: Fixed image size for the first item, and added a boarder to check out what it looks like. I'm starting to like the current size of the button (it's quite large at the moment) I"ll see if It feels good when I get the test code into the .js

Commit 4: I need to remember to clear my cache as I'm testing. Some of the updates have applied but old cache is getting in the way. I may also want to look into disabling cache on this website while testing.

Commit 5: added js to the project. Testing out functions and learning as I go. Thanks to https://replit.com/talk/learn/How-to-Make-a-Responsive-Clicker-Game-in-HTML-CSS-JS/141212 for creating a starting point to jump off of. I'm also using and app Called Mimo at the same time. I'm following the Full-Stack Development path and just got to HTML Intermediate section. I will continue to learn using Mimo and playing around with the code. I've played the game for about 30 seconds, and it works, but it is not fun yet. I'm going to try and figure out a few new things now. I know clicker games are origianlly about bringing your clicks per second up but I want to reinvent the wheel. I want to mess around with the click mechanic with different outcomes.

Goals Next Session: 
Make a narrator to tell a story. As the players use the Search Button, I want a chance for the narrator to talk.
Change how the search button works. When the player clicks the button a chance for 3 options will occur. 
Option 1 is saltWaterResourcesLevelOne at a 95% chance. If you get them you have a 75% chance for Mud and a 25% chance for clay
Option 2 is spawningPoolLoreLevelOne at a 4% chance. Getting this will advance the story of this location
Option 3 is weirdObject1 at a 1% chance. Use this to do something different each time to stretch your capabilities and try unique things out.

Commit 1: I made some new resources to add to the Clay and Mud. These resources are living creatures.
