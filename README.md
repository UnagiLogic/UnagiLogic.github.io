This is a goal I'm working on.

I'm gonna keep track of what I've done in here just for Fun

I made my Git Repository following the instructions found here https://pages.github.com/
After 6 hours I found out Repositories don't like to be placed on exFat file systems
which was why I couldn't get past the "record ownership information step"

11/13/2023 - It's 3:45AM and now that I'm using a NTFS File System, everything worked like a charm. I've added an index.html with some bare bones code, an app.js with even less code, and an adventure_theme.css with a little bit of code. With this success, I'm going to commit and go to sleep.

Commit 1: Today I worked on getting some more elements in the HTML and CSS for testing purposes. I'm gonna make changes until it looks how I want. I made an initial commit to see the in progress work. 

Commit 2: Changed the Title to the top of the page, and downsized the image so It's a little more center stage. I'm realizing that the image I'm currently using I wanted in the background and then buttons layered on top of it. I will need to think about how to approach this change and then continue forward.

Observation 1: One observationn I've made while starting this project is my goal to make a unique experience for players. I've always wanted to create an experience that depends of each other to accomplish large goals. This is a potential goal of this project but when I start to ask questions about how to accomplish this, lots of situations arise. I'm gonna post some of the demanding questions so I can look back at them from time to time as I work on this project.

Questions to ask:
I want resource gathering to feel unique. If players can't gather resources that they need fast enough, what else are they doing in the meantime?

Commit 3: Fixed image size for the first item, and added a boarder to check out what it looks like. I'm starting to like the current size of the button (it's quite large at the moment) I"ll see if It feels good when I get the test code into the .js
