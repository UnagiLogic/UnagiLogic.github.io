This is a goal I'm working on. I'm gonna make my own game
It's got a clicker game base and then I'm going to mess around with the genre to make some new features
I'm gonna take some of my favorite genres from when I was a kid and just try to put them together into something that's fun
One concept I'm going to mess around with is tower defense.
There was an old game I use to play and I don't know the name anymore but It was simple and fun. At some point I'm going to try and add features I remember from that
