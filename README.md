This is a dream I'm working on.

I'm gonna keep track of what I've done in here just for Fun

11/12/2023
I made my Git Repository following the instructions found here https://pages.github.com/
After 6 hours I found out Repositories don't like to be placed on exFat File Systems.
which was why I couldn't get past the "record ownership information step"

11/13/2023 - It's 3:45AM and now that I'm using a NTFS File System, everything worked like a charm. I've added an index.html with some bare bones code, an app.js with even less code, and an adventure_theme.css with a little bit of code. With this success, I'm going to commit and go to sleep.
