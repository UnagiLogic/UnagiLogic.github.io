This is just a useful guide for myself as I learn to code

Git Repository - Use these commands when you want to commit some changes to the website
cd UnagiLogic.github.io

git add --all
git commit -m "add a comment about the commit here"
git push -u origin main

Node server.js - Use this when you want to start your personal server on your laptop

CSS Reminders

Selector, Property          Value
P         Color:            Blue;
Body      Background-color: Orange;

//Below is a rule
.this-thing {
    color: black;
}

[HTML]
id="thisID" Needs to be unique when used
Don't overuse these as they will help later with javascript
class="golden" Does not need to be unique

[CSS]   Example
#id     #thisID
.class  .golden


font-weight: bold;

padding -   Top     Right   Bottom  Left
            12      3       6       9
            20px    0       20px    0
