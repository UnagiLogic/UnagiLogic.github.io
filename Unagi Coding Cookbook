This is just a useful guide for myself as I learn to code

Git Repository - Use these commands when you want to commit some changes to the website
cd UnagiLogic.github.io

git add --all
git commit -m "add a comment about the commit here"
git push -u origin main

Node server.js - Use this when you want to start your personal server on your laptop

CSS Reminders

Selector, Property          Value
P         Color:            Blue;
Body      Background-color: Orange;

//Below is a rule
.this-thing {
    color: black;
}

[WHAT I DONT UNDERSTAND]
ID Selectors:
Are like unique identifiers for each character, object, or item in the game
Are specific to a single element and cannot be used to select multiple elements
Can be used to access a specific element directly
Example: If you wanted to collect a coin with the ID coin-123, you could use the following code
var coin = document.getElementById('coin-123');

Class selectors:
Are like groups of characters, objects, or items in the game
Can be used to select multiple elements with the same class attribute
Are often used to apply styles to multiple elements at once
For example: If you wanted to collect all of the coins with the class coin, you could use the following code:
var coins = document.getElementsByClassName('coin');

[HTML]
id="thisID" Needs to be unique when used
Don't overuse these as they will help later with javascript
class="golden" Does not need to be unique

[CSS]   Example
#id     #thisID
.class  .golden
padding -   Top     Right   Bottom  Left
            12      3       6       9
            North   East    South   West
            20px    0       20px    0

[JS]
console.log()
You can place a variable in here to log it
When you update a value, it forgets its previous value.
Adding string values together is called an expression
true; false;
! is a negation operator. It turns values into their opposite
=== checks if two numbers are the same
!== checks if a number isn't equal to another number
.innerText will make the HTML element contain the text we give it.
fish = fish + fishPerClick can be written fish += fishPerClick
