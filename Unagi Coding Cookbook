This is just a useful guide for myself as I learn to code

Git Repository - Use these commands when you want to commit some changes to the website
cd UnagiLogic.github.io

git add --all
git commit -m "add a comment about the commit here"
git push -u origin main

Node server.js - Use this when you want to start your personal server on your laptop

CSS Reminders

Selector, Property          Value
P         Color:            Blue;
Body      Background-color: Orange;

//Below is a rule
.this-thing {
    color: black;
}

[HTML]
id="thisID" Needs to be unique when used
Don't overuse these as they will help later with javascript
class="golden" Does not need to be unique

[CSS]   Example
#id     #thisID
.class  .golden
padding -   Top     Right   Bottom  Left
            12      3       6       9
            North   East    South   West
            20px    0       20px    0

[JS]
console.log()
You can place a variable in here to log it
When you update a value, it forgets its previous value.
Adding string values together is called an expression
true; false;
! is a negation operator. It turns values into their opposite
=== checks if two numbers are the same
!== checks if a number isn't equal to another number
.innerText will make the HTML element contain the text we give it.
fish = fish + fishPerClick can be written fish += fishPerClick
